        1. In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking machine that would help
        him get around the royal gardens faster.

      <p>
        2. The device know as the Draisienne (or "hobby horse") was made of
        wood, and propelled by pushing your feed on the ground in a gliding
        movement.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. It was not seen a suitable for any place other than a well maintained
        pathway.

        4. In 1865, the velocipede (meaning "fast foot") attached pedals to the
        front wheel, but its wooden structure made it extremely uncomfortable.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. In 1870 the first all-metal machine appeared. The pedals were
        attached directly to the front wheel.
      </p>
      <p>
        6. Solid rubber tires and the long spokes of the large front wheel
        provided a much smoother ride than its predecessor.
